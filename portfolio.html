    <h2>Languages</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Javascript: Get so good at it that I can build a commercial grade SaaS application from scratch</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Node.js + Express</li>
            <li>React for the front end</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Databases</h2>
    <ul><li>MongoDB. And maybe SQL as well</li></ul>
    
    <h2>Platforms</h2>
    <ul><li>Meteor for rapid prototyping</li></ul>
    
    
    <h2>Version Control</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My git knowledge is iffy right now. I want to get to the point where git commands are done on autopilot</li>
        <li>GitLab has free private repos so I will also learn how to use that. Shouldn't take much time at all.</li>
    </ul>    
    
    <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Linux. I'm an Ubuntu novice; it's on my Virtual machine but I avoid it due to lag</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Other Tools</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Debuggers. I plan to target prospects on legacy systems. That means my day to day will be debugging</li>
        <li>Anything that helps me make sense of a large code base. I don't understand how developers can jump into these mammoths. It is a must-learn.</li>
        <li>Scraping. I will be working a lot with data gathering through non-API means.</li>
        <li>Proxy usage and emailing through CLI scripts or little web interfaces.</li>
        <li>Prototyping tools that can be shown to customers online for testing and feedback</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If I can get good at these tools I'll be pretty happy with my technical proficiency. I'm not the type to suffer from imposter syndrome once I hit my own benchmarks.</p>

    <h2>Soft skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I'll work out a plan for online outreach and also phone calls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Career Goals</h1>
    
    <p>I want to be a freelancer who serves legacy systems. This is my main goal. I know freelancing is a more difficult path to pursue early on, but I'll put everything into marketing for clients after I build a technical skillset.</p> 
    
    <p>On the side I will build web apps as well. I won't build them until I reach out to a target B2B audience, find out exactly what they need, and have a few of them play with a prototype I make in Balsamiq.</p>

            <li>I'm a Javascript novice. That's all for now.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Version Control</h2>
        <ul>I can use Git but I'm still slow at it.</ul>
        
        <h2>Operation Systems</h2>
        
        <ul><li>I'm on Windows 10 and reasonably comfortable with it</li></ul>

        <ul><li>Cloud 9 is my main IDE. I also use webstorm if the internet gets shaky</li>
